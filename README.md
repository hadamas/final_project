## Description 

This is a final project developed for the Dynamic Front End module within the Santander Coders 2023 program. The project involves the creation of a dynamic online portfolio that allows users to display information about their skills, work experience, contact details and so on. We have utilized Angular, CSS, Bootstrap, HTML, and JavaScript to develop the portfolio's interface and functionalities. Furthermore, we have applied CSS and Bootstrap for styles and responsiveness to ensure a user-friendly experience on various devices. Dynamic features, such as project display, contact information, and other relevant sections, have been integrated. Project version control is managed using Git and Github to facilitate collaboration among group members.
